        <img id="babyHercules" src="baby_hercules.jpeg" alt="Baby Hercules strangling the snakes">
            <p>When Hercules was born, his stepmother, Hera, was jealous. 
                As a result, she attempted to kill Hercules shortly after he was born. 
                She sent 2 snakes into his crib to kill him. 
                However, she underestimated Hercules’ strength, as 
                he strangled the snakes before they were able to kill him.

            She may have been unsuccessful this time, but she 
            did not stop trying to make his life miserable. 
            When Hercules was a young adult with his own wife 
            and children, Hera cast a spell on Hercules that 
            drove him to kill his family.

        <h2>12 Labors of Hercules</h2>
        <p>
            When he was freed from the spell, he was faced 
            with immense guilt and heartbreak. This inspired 
            him to find Apollo, the God of Truth, to whom 
            he begged to be punished for his actions. Apollo 
            ordered him to complete 12 tasks or “labors” for the 
            Mycenaen king, Eurystheus. These became known as the 
            12 Labors of Hercules. Apollo declared that once 
            these labors were completed, Hercules would be free 
            of guilt and would achieve immortality. To read 
            more about each of the 12 Labors, navigate to 
            the “12 Labors of Hercules” page of the website.

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
            After Hercules completed his 12 tasks, he got 
            remarried to a woman named Deianira. During 
            their marriage, a centaur attempted to steal 
            Deianira from Hercules. Hercules ended up shooting him 
            with a poisonous arrow. As the centaur lay dying, 
            he realized his blood was now poisonous and gave 
            Deianira a blood-stained tunic, claiming it would 
            keep her forever binded to Hercules. Years later, 
            Deianira heard rumors that Hercules was having an affair. 
            In an effort to bring him back to her, she gave him the 
            blood-stained tunic to wear. What she didn’t realize, 
            however, was that the tunic was poisonous. Hercules 
            ended up dying as a result of this. After his death, 
            he was taken to Olympus to spend the rest of eternity with the Gods.
