    <h2>The Nemean Lion</h2>
    <p>
        For his first labor, Hercules was 
        sent to the hills of Nemea, where 
        a lion was terrorizing the people. 
        Hercules was tasked with killing 
        this lion in order. To do so, he 
        trapped the lion in a cave and 
        strangled it. He wore the animal’s 
        pelt as a cloak for the remainder 
        of his life. 
    </p>

    <h2>The Lernaean Hydra</h2>
    <p>
        For his next task, Hercules was 
        sent to Lerna, where a nine-headed, 
        poisonous snake called Hydra who 
        lived underwater was blocking the 
        entrance to the Underworld. The 
        issue, however, was that when one 
        of the heads was cut off, a new 
        head would grow back. Therefore, 
        Hercules would need help. With 
        the help of his nephew, Iolaus, 
        Hercules was able to sever each 
        of the 9 heads while Iolaus 
        torched each wound, preventing 
        a new head from growing back.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Golden Hind</h2>
    <p>
        This next task did not include 
        Hercules slaying any beasts. 
        Instead, he was sent to the goddess 
        Diana, where he was tasked with 
        stealing her sacred pet. It was 
        a red deer with golden antlers 
        and bronze hooves. Eurystheus 
        believed that Diana would kill 
        anyone who tried to come for 
        her precious pet. However, he 
        underestimated Hercules’ charm 
        because as soon as Hercules 
        explained his situation to Diana, 
        she let him go on his way with 
        no repercussions. 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Erymanthean Boar</h2>
    <p>
        For his 4th task, Hercules was 
        sent to Mount Erymanthus to kill 
        a man-eating boar. Using a giant 
        net to trap the boar, he was successful.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Augean Stables</h2>
    <p>
        Eurystheus chose this next task 
        because he believed it to be 
        humiliating as well as impossible. 
        Hercules was instructed with 
        cleaning all 3,000+ of King Augeas’ 
        horse stables in one day. Hercules, 
        being determined to complete all 12 
        labors and being as clever as he 
        was, realized this was impossible 
        to do by hand. This forced him to 
        get creative. He built a dam, 
        causing a river to run through 
        the stables, cleaning it in no time. 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Stymphlaian Birds</h2>
    <p>
        The 6th labor included Hercules 
        going to the town of Stymphalos 
        and driving away a huge flock of 
        carnivorous birds that had been 
        occupying the town’s trees for 
        some time. To accomplish this, 
        he had the assistance of the 
        goddess Athena. She provided him 
        with a magical noisemaker that 
        was made by another god, Hephaistos. 
        Using this tool, Hercules had 
        no troubles scaring the birds away.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Cretan Bull</h2>
    <p>
        Hercules was then sent to Crete 
        to capture a bull that had impregnated 
        the king of the island’s wife, Pasiphae. 
        He successfully captured the bull, 
        turned it over to Eurystheus, who let 
        it free in Marathon, Greece. Pasiphae 
        ended up giving birth to a creature 
        with the head of a bull and the body of a man.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Horses of Diomedes</h2>
    <p>
        For his 8th labor, Hercules was sent 
        to capture the 4 man-eating horses 
        that were terrorizing the Thracian 
        king, Diomedes. He was successful 
        and brought them to Eurystheus, 
        who gave them to Hera.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Hippolyte's Belt</h2>
    <p>
        This labor, seemingly easy at first, 
        ended up being more trouble for 
        Hercules than he anticipated. He 
        was instructed to steal the belt 
        from the Amazon queen Hippolyte. 
        She initially agreed to give him 
        the belt with no trouble, but 
        Hera spread a rumor that Hercules 
        was going to kidnap Hippolyte. 
        The women of the Amazon attacked 
        Hercules as a result of this rumor. 
        Fearing for his life, he killed 
        Hippolyte and ripped the belt from her body.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Cattle of Geryon</h2>
    <p>
        Next, Hercules was sent to Africa 
        to steal the cattle of the three-headed, 
        six-legged monster called Geryon. Hera 
        interfered as much as she could to prevent 
        Hercules from being successful, but 
        nevertheless, he succeeded and returned 
        to Mycenae with the cattle.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Apples of Hesperides</h2>
    <p>
        For his second-to-last labor, Hercules 
        was instructed to steal Hera’s wedding 
        gift to Zeus: a set of golden apples. 
        These apples were heavily guarded by a 
        group of nymphs called the Hesperides. 
        This task proved very difficult for Hercules, 
        and he was only successful after 
        getting help from Prometheus and Atlas. 
        He got away with the apples, showed them 
        to Eurystheus, and then returned them to 
        the gods’ garden where they belonged.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Cerberus</h2>
    <p>
        For his final challenge, Hercules was 
        sent to Hades to kidnap Cerberus, the 
        aggressive and ferocious three-headed 
        dog that guarded the gates. He used 
        his immense strength to wrestle and 
        restrain the dog, who was then returned 
        unharmed to his post at the entrance 
        of the Underworld.
